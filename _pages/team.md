**Thomas Fletcher**, Postdoctoral Researcher (2024 - )\
Prior to joining the group, Tom was previously a postdoctoral researcher at King's College London from 2020-2024. He worked on using machine learning for reconstruction of highly undersampled cardiac MRI. Tom obtained his PhD in Astrophysics from University College London (UCL) in 2020, where his research focused on understanding the first galaxies using ground and space-based telescopes. He received an MSc in Astrophysics and MSci in Physics from UCL and Imperial respectively. He has also worked as a Research Scientist at the National Physical Laboratory.
Tom's research interests include machine learning approaches for inverse problems, motion correction and highly undersampled reconstruction in MRI. He will be working on motion-robust and efficient fMRI.<br />

<img align="left" width="200" src="/images/Emily.jpg" style="margin-right: 15px" /> 

**[Emily Yik Kwan Chan](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/emily.chan21)**, PhD Student (2022 - )\
Emily is a PhD student whose current research is focusing on traumatic brain injury (TBI) prediction in head impact caused by rapid mechanical loading in sports, which lies in the intersection of kinematics, neuroscience and engineering. She is investigating the biomechanic mechanism of the head impacts in sports, identifying the risk factor of neurodegeneration, and surrogate modelling of finite element methods by machine learning methods, with the aim of real-time TBI prediction for sporting collisions. 
Emily is supervised by Dr Mazdak Ghajari at [Human Experience, Analysis and Design (HEAD) Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/human-experience-analysis-design/) at Dyson School of Design Engineering, and co-supervised by Dr Qin Chen at Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College. Her PhD study is funded by [Sports and Wellbeing Analytics (SWA)](https://swa.one/), a progressive player in the field of wearable technology.  <br />
